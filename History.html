 <p class="te3">The first stationary gasoline engine developed by Carl Benz was a one-cylinder two-stroke unit which ran for the first time on New Year’s Eve 1879. Benz had so much commercial success with this engine that he was able to devote more time to his dream of creating a lightweight car powered by a gasoline engine, in which the chassis and engine formed a single unit.</p>

    The oldest running car in the world is La Marquise, an 1884 model made in France. It has a steam engine and three wheels. The car was entered in an 1887 exhibition race from Paris to Versailles. It was the only competitor to show up.

La Marquise was sold at auction for $4.62 million, which was more than double the pre-sale estimate. It's also known as the world's oldest competition car.

  <p class="te5">Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé
Not only is this the rarest car on this list, but it is also the most expensive one by far. Only two examples of the 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé were ever produced, one with a blue interior and the other with a red one. While Mercedes owns one of the two models and it is available for display at their museum, the other one was recently sold at an auction for a whopping $143 million. This makes it the most expensive car to ever be sold. The 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé is a two-seater sportscar that gets gullwing doors and a long bonnet under which resides a longitudinally-mounted 3.0-litre engine.</p>

    PAL-V: the Personal Air and Land Vehicle, the world’s first flying car. Or is it ‘a plane that’s also a car’? ‘Simply fill up with Euro 95 and fly to London, Paris, or Frankfurt at 180 km/h.’

As explained by Beau Metz, Marketing and Sales Officer at PAL-V: ‘People have been dreaming about flying cars for 100 years – Henry Ford was one of those people. All of those brilliant visionaries have been trying to create a vehicle of the future. It looks fantastic on paper, but there’s not much you can do with it in real life. That’s why PAL-V, which is compatible with existing infrastructure, focuses on the possibilities within legislation and regulations. As it can use normal roads and small airports, it really is the flying car of today.’

 <p class="te3">The sQuba, developed by Swiss company Rinspeed, is the world's first car that can be driven both on land and underwater. The original idea by Rinspeed founder and CEO Frank M. Rinderknecht was inspired by the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. The chassis from the Lotus Elise is used as the base for this vehicle</p>
